# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

This directory contains my Python implementations of core data structures and algorithms as part of my preparation for advanced computer science coursework.

## Implemented Data Structures

- AVL Tree
- HashMap (Linear Probing)
- Graph (Adjacency List)

## Implemented Algorithms

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Bubble Sort (with last-swap optimization)
- Merge Sort

All implementations are written from scratch for learning and practice purposes.
