# Java Data Structures Implementation

This project implements fundamental data structures from scratch in Java, including:

- AVL Tree with rotation-based rebalancing
- Custom HashMap with collision handling and dynamic resizing
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS)
- Sorting algorithms

Each implementation includes algorithmic complexity analysis (Big-O) and structured validation testing.

## Objective

This project was developed to strengthen foundational understanding of data structures and algorithmic thinking in preparation for rigorous graduate-level computer science coursework.
